<p>Holi is an ancient Hindu festival that celebrates spring, love, and the victory of good over evil, often called the "Festival of Colors". Celebrated for a day and a night between late February and mid-March, it features bonfires called Holika Dahan on the first night and the playful throwing of colored powder and water on the second day, known as Rang Panchami. The festival is a time for unity, forgiveness, and community, as people gather to sing, dance, eat traditional sweets, and play with colors, forgetting past grievances.</p>
