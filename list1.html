Fruits are the seed-bearing, ripened ovaries of flowering plants that provide essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water, serving a vital role in plant reproduction and human nutrition. While culinary definitions focus on sweet, fleshy produce, the botanical definition includes seed-bearing structures like tomatoes, cucumbers, and nuts. Fruits are classified into fleshy (e.g., apples, berries) or dry (e.g., nuts, beans) types and can be consumed fresh, cooked, or processed into jams, juices, and other dishes.
