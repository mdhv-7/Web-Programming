Vegetables are the edible parts of plants, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds, which are crucial for a healthy diet. They are low in calories, high in fiber, and rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that protect against chronic diseases like heart disease and some cancers. Vegetables can be eaten raw or cooked and come in many varieties, with common examples including carrots (roots), spinach (leaves), broccoli (flowers), potatoes (tubers, a type of stem), and even foods botanically classified as fruits, such as tomatoes and cucumbers, but are used as vegetables in cooking.
