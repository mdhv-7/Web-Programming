Flowers, the colorful blossoms of plants, are primarily the reproductive structures of flowering plants (angiosperms), responsible for producing seeds to ensure the species' continuation. They possess diverse forms, sizes, and colors and attract pollinators like insects and birds, which facilitate pollination. Flowers have four main parts: protective sepals, colorful petals, male stamens, and female pistils, all working to achieve reproduction through the transfer of pollen and fertilization. Humans use flowers for decoration, gifts, food, and medicine, and they hold deep cultural and symbolic meaning across many societies.
